        <dd>2 tablespoons olive oil.</dd>
        <dt>3</dt>
        <dd>1 tablespoon capers, drained</dd>
        <dt>4</dt>
        <dd>½ cup white wine</dd>
        <dt>5</dt>
        <dd>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</dd>
        <dt>6</dt>
        <dd>¼ cup water</dd>
        <dt>5</dt>
        <dd>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</dd>
        <dt>6</dt>
        <dd>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</dd>
    </dl>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick</p>
        <p>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</p>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</p>
        <p>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</p>
        <p>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</p>
