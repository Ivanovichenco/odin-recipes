        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>1 -Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick</p>
        <p>2-Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</p>
        <p>3-Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</p>
        <p>4-Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>5- Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>6-Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</p>
        <p>7-Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</p>
